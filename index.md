# Monika - DNS blocklist archive

This site hosts a few archived blocklists from across the internet, including squidblacklist.org, hosts-file.net, abuse.ch (zeustracker/ranswomwaretracker), and notrack. Most (if not all) of these lists are no longer available at their original locations and were recovered thanks to the [Wayback Machine](https://archive.org/).

[View the blocklists here](/blocklists).

This site and hosted blocklists are maintained on [Github](http://www.example.org).
You can also get in touch with me at [sup@rubesty.io](mailto:sup@rubesty.io) for any questions or issues.
